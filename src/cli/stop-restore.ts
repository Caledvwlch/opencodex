 * `ocx sync`, and its client runtime never writes them on start. The standalone teardown
 * restored native Codex, rewrote the catalog and stripped the Grok block, and nothing on the
 * client put any of it back: `ocx start` brought the runtime up with Codex still native and
 * Grok unconfigured. Leaving them in place makes stop/start a round trip; `ocx disconnect`
 * remains the teardown that owns them, with its own ownership checks.

/**
 * Restore shared client state after a stop.

 * Returns the two failure kinds separately. `historyOnly` means teardown succeeded and
 * only Codex history metadata could not be finalized: the proxy is down, the service is
 * stopped, and a manifest is waiting for review. `other` means something that actually
 * removes state a client depends on.
 *
 * The distinction exists because `ocx update` must proceed for the first and abort for the
 * second, and it can only see an exit code (#3008).
 *
 * `historyDeferred` is the third kind (#4718). The Codex history preflight refuses BEFORE
 * the config half runs, so nothing was restored at all: config, catalog, history and
 * provenance are untouched and the client is still routed at the proxy that just stopped.
 * Like `historyOnly` the proxy is genuinely down, so an update may replace package files.
 * Unlike `historyOnly` the obligation was not performed, so the receipt must survive.
